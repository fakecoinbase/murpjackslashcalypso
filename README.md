**Chrome extension**

# Calypso-balance

Keep track of a handful of cryptocurrencies from your Chrome browser.
Cryptocurrencies regularly change in price throughout the course of the day and it only takes a quick peek to keep up to speed.   
Calypso does this and you won't even need to open any more tabs in your browser!

In time I hope to add more functionality. At present Calypso is a no-frills Chrome extension.
