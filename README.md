Calypso is a simple Chrome extension written using ReactJS.
Keep track of a handful of cryptocurrencies from your Chrome browser.
Cryptocurrencies regularly change in price throughout the course of the day and it only takes a quick peek to keep up to speed.   

**Note.** This Chrome extension currently requires no browser permissions as it handles no personal data.
